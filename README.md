# Portfolio & Creative Space

This homepage is **not just a portfolio** – it’s also a **space for collecting ideas, experiments, and mini-projects**.  
It reflects my current **experience and skills**, but also serves as a place to **learn new technologies** and continuously **grow as a developer**.  

## What you’ll find here  
- Mini-projects
- Code experiments
- Learning in progress
